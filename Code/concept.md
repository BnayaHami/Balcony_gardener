This code sets up an Arduino-based device with WiFi connectivity to create a web server that provides functionality for measuring soil humidity and controlling a watering mechanism for plants. The code utilizes the WiFi, WebServer, and ArduinoJson libraries to establish a connection, handle HTTP requests, and parse JSON data.

The main functionality of the code revolves around the handleRoot(), handleStartWatering(), and handleMeasurements() functions.

The handleRoot() function generates an HTML page that allows the user to select the pot size and vegetation type. Upon submitting the form, an AJAX request is made to the server to trigger the handleMeasurements() function. The response from this function is then displayed on the HTML page, showing the average humidity and a result indicating whether the humidity level is considered good or bad for the chosen vegetation type. If the result is "Bad," a button is enabled to start the watering process.

The handleStartWatering() function is called when the user clicks the "Start Watering" button. It retrieves the selected pot size and determines the watering duration based on the pot size. It then activates a designated pin (A4) to initiate the watering process for the specified duration. After completion, a response is sent back to the client.

The handleMeasurements() function calculates the average humidity by taking multiple analog readings of the soil moisture sensor. The humidity readings are accumulated and divided by the number of valid measurements. The average humidity value is then compared with predefined thresholds based on the vegetation type selected. The function determines whether the humidity level is good or bad for the selected vegetation type and constructs a JSON response containing the average humidity and the result.

The setup() function initializes the WiFi connection, sets pin A4 as an output for the watering mechanism, defines the server endpoints, and starts the server. The loop() function continuously handles incoming client requests.

In summary, this code creates a web interface for users to choose the pot size and vegetation type, receive feedback on the average soil humidity, and trigger the watering process if necessary.
